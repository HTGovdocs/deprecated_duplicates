Perhaps use latent semantic analysis on the govdocs? 
Some sort of tf-idf?

How to best normalize prop and val further (so no values are duplicated in the db)

vvv DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? vvv

find_clusters(['title_series', 'agency']).each do |cluster|
  make_cluster(cluster);
end

mysql> select count(distinct gd_item_id), count(distinct gd_cluster_id) from gd_item_cluster;
| count(distinct gd_item_id) | count(distinct gd_cluster_id) |
|                       1600 |                           816 |

... but:

find_clusters(['title_series', 'agency', 'pub_date']).each do |cluster|
  make_cluster(cluster);
end

mysql> select count(distinct gd_item_id), count(distinct gd_cluster_id) from gd_item_cluster;
| count(distinct gd_item_id) | count(distinct gd_cluster_id) |
|                       1134 |                           991 |

That is, the more specific the cluster definition the more clusters and the fewer clustered documents.
The less specific the cluster definition the more clustered documents and the fewer clusters.

... I guess that makes sense.

^^^ DID THAT MAKE SENSE ^^^
